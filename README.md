1. jax-version td mpc
2. distributionally robust soft actor critic (online learning)

Generative model for model learning
1. VAE
2. Flow matching
3. diffusion 
### Reproducibility / GPU Precision Issues
Users with NVIDIA Ampere architecture GPUs (e.g., RTX 30 and 40 series) may experience reproducibility [issues](https://github.com/google-deepmind/mujoco_playground/issues/86) in mujoco_playground due to JAXâ€™s default use of TF32 for matrix multiplications. This lower precision can adversely affect RL training stability. To ensure consistent behavior with systems using full float32 precision (as on Turing GPUs), please run `export JAX_DEFAULT_MATMUL_PRECISION=highest` in your terminal before starting your experiments (or add it to the end of `~/.bashrc`).
